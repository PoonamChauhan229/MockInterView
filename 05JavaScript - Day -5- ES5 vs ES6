Mock Interview:

Q1: Compare and contrast var, let, and const in JavaScript. What are the differences in terms of scope and variable reassignment?

Q2: Explain the concept of block scoping introduced in ES6. How does block scoping differ from function scoping in JavaScript?

Q3: What are spread (...) and rest (...args) operators in ES6? How do you use them with arrays and function parameters?

Q4: Discuss array and object destructuring in ES6. How can you use destructuring to extract values from arrays and objects more efficiently?

Q5: What is object property shorthand in ES6? Provide an example of how you can simplify object property assignment using shorthand notation.

Q6: Explain template literals (template strings) in ES6. How do template literals differ from traditional string concatenation?

Q7: Discuss the advantages of arrow functions (=>) introduced in ES6. How do arrow functions handle this differently compared to regular functions?

Q8: How does ES6 address common pitfalls of var declarations with the introduction of let and const?

Q9: What are the benefits of using const for variable declarations in ES6? How does const ensure immutability for object references?

Q10: Explain the use of spread operator (...) to clone arrays and objects in JavaScript

Q11: How can you use array destructuring to swap variables without using a temporary variable in ES6?
